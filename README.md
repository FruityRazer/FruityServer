# FruityServer

Example implementation of an app using FruityKit.

This project is currently in a **works for me** state, so consider it pre-alpha software.

Currently supported devices: Please check [FruityKit](https://github.com/FruityRazer/FruityKit).

## Compiling

You need to have both CocoaPods and Carthage on your system.

 - `pod install`
 - `carthage update --platform macOS`
 
 After that, open the generated workspace and compile.

## Documentation

None so far, but the code should be self-descriptive.

## License

This project uses the GPLv2 license.
