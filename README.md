# FruityRazer

Open-source Razer drivers for macOS.

This project is currently in a **works for me** state, so consider it pre-alpha software.

Currently supported devices:

 - Razer Base Station Chroma
 - Razer Firefly
 - Razer Huntsman Elite
 - Razer Mamba

## Compiling

Just compile the project using a recent version of Xcode.

## Documentation

None so far.

Check out the [FruityUI](https://github.com/FruityRazer/FruityUI) project for some examples on how to use it.

If you just want to use the drivers, download the latest release from the [FruityUI](https://github.com/FruityRazer/FruityUI) project, since it also includes FruityRazer.
